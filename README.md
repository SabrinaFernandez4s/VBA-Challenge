# VBA-Challenge

Hi, it took me a lot of hours to write this code.

There should be 3 different Subs in the VBA script, but they should run altogether once you play the first Sub.

The bonus part theoretically should work, but I never got it to show up on my file.

Lastly, I've also included 3 separate screenshots of the results from the masterfile. They should all be correct :)
